      <h1>Teams and Organizations</h1>
      <p>At BodyMindBusiness, we live for that giddy feeling when we witness high-fives exchanged between co-workers who connect on something special. If this inspired feeling is what you are seeking in your organization, you are in the right place. You know what we are talking about -- that feeling of flow, harmony, juiciness, inclusion, strength and unstoppable unity.</p>
      <p><a href="#unprogramming"><em>Unprogramming</em></a> means we are inviting you to throw out all the masters, the experts, the authorities, and the “they who say you should…”. and recreate your team’s true brilliance. At BodyMindBusiness, our most inspired work is in helping you remember and recharge the common motivating force that  brought your team together and to help you realize how easily your organization can achieve the impossible and beyond.</p>
      <p>One of our mottos at BodyMindBusiness is <em>“it doesn’t have to be hard”</em> and it really doesn’t. Teams and organizations constantly shift and change, coming together and dissolving, working well and then not. This is completely natural and inescapable so stop resisting it and learn to go with the flow.</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>When we work with teams and organizations at BodyMindBusiness, we start with two fundamental concepts. </p>
          <ol type=1>
              <li><strong>You possess everything you need</strong>, right here and right now. Everyone matters, contributes and adds value even if it is only their presence. </li>
              <li><strong>Commit to supporting each other-</strong>- build each other up. Recognize the truth of who and what each of you are –special, unique, fully capable, creative, extraordinary beings – and feel the truth of your purpose. </li>
          </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p> From there all things are possible. Your organization will automatically shift into alignment. Team members who felt stuck before may realize that their truth of purpose is not aligned and other possibilities will be presented to them. Team members who were afraid before will realize that they are fully supported by their co-workers and will begin to achieve amazing results. Teams may realize that their goals weren’t big enough and they will shift to dream even bigger! The ebb and flow will keep you moving forward.</p>
      <p>Sound too good to be true? Well don’t sell yourself short. It's not about what BodyMindBusiness has to offer you, it is about what you can offer yourself. It is all within you right now. What we do for you is shine the light on what you already know is true. We are certain that by reading these words, you are starting to think differently and you are at this moment allowing shift to happen.</p>
