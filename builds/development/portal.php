            <h1>Teams and Organizations</h1>
            <p>At BodyMindBusiness, we live for that giddy feeling when we witness high-fives exchanged between co-workers after stumbling on an elegantly inspired idea or solution. If this inspired feeling is what you are seeking in your organization, you are in the right place. You know what we are talking about -- that feeling of flow, harmony, juiciness, inclusion, strength and unstoppable unity.</p>
            <p><a href="#unprogramming"><em>Unprogramming</em></a> means we are inviting you to throw out all the masters, the experts, the authorities, and the “they who say you should…”. and recreate your team’s true brilliance. At BodyMindBusiness, our most inspired work is in helping you remember the real reason you are here, the common motivating force that has brought your team together and to help you realize just how easily your organization can achieve the impossible and beyond.</p>
            <p>One of our mottos at BodyMindBusiness is <em>“it doesn’t have to be hard”</em> and it really doesn’t. Teams and organizations are always changing and shifting, coming together and dissolving, working well and then not. Like a pendulum or a wave in the ocean, we are in constant motion. This is completely natural and inescapable so stop resisting it and learn to go with the flow.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>When we work with teams and organizations at BodyMindBusiness, we start with two fundamental concepts. </p>
                <ol type=1>
                    <li><strong>You possess everything you need</strong>, right here and right now. Everyone matters, contributes and adds value even if it is only their presence. </li>
                    <li><strong>Commit to supporting each other-</strong>- build each other up. Recognize the truth of who and what each of you are –special, unique, fully capable, creative, extraordinary beings – and feel the truth of your purpose. </li>
                </ol>
            </blockquote>
            <p> From there all things are possible, in big ways and small ways. Your organization will automatically shift into alignment and the engines will start to hum. Team members who felt stuck before may realize that their truth of purpose is not aligned and other possibilities will be presented to them. Team members who were afraid before will realize that they are fully supported by their co-workers and will begin to achieve amazing results. Teams may realize that their goals weren’t big enough and they will shift to dream even bigger! And regardless of the cycle of the pendulum or the ebb and flow of the wave you keep moving forward, no hands, no brakes just flow.</p>
            <p>Sound too good to be true? Well don’t sell yourself short. It is not about what BodyMindBusiness has to offer you, it is about what you can offer yourself. It is all within you right now. What we do for you is to simply shine the light on what you already know is true. We are certain that by just reading these words, you are starting to think differently and you are at this moment allowing shift to happen.</p>

        <article class="inspired-text" id="individual-anchor">
            <h1>Individuals and Entrepreneurs </h1>
            <p>There are so many great things about being independent -- as an entrepreneur owning your own business, an entrepreneur in an organization, or an individual having a unique talent or product or an intensely compelling and individual calling. It’s great to be your own boss; to make your own decisions without having to consult someone else or get other’s buy-in. You can turn on a dime, abandon projects that aren’t working and try things just for the fun of it. Facts and figures are not always required. You can fly by the seat of your pants, rely on your intuition and go on a hunch. As great as having an individual calling can be it can be equally scary and overwhelming, if not paralyzing.</p>
            <p>A common thread appears with individuals who seek us at BodyMindBusiness. People often ask “What is so obvious to you that I cannot see? Will you teach me how to operate at the pace of love so that I too can experience true abundance and authentic happiness?” The people we are seeking who are seeking us know deep down in their heart of hearts that there is something more. Sometimes they know what it is, sometimes they don’t and sometimes what they think it is is not at all what they discover once they realize their truth.  That is how awesomely exciting a connection with your divine truth can be. Typically, this connection requires two-phases. It isn’t a program or a recipe it just happens in two parts. You can’t remodel your house without tearing down a few walls or clearing out your old belongings. </p>

            <blockquote>
                <h4>The <a href="#unprogramming"><em>Unprogramming</em></a></h4>
                <p>This is the hardest part but required to get to the juicy part. To get through a pinch-point or to operate at a higher level, we all must go through some unprogramming. The first step when you come to BodyMindBusiness is to recognize, acknowledge and release your self-limiting beliefs. You will need to get out of your head and let go of your own expectations of how things should be, of who you think you should be and release the expectations that others have for you that you have agreed to. Not so hard, right?</p>
                <p>We all have this clutter and in some areas we are more entrenched than others. Completing the first pass doesn’t guarantee you won’t have to do it again as new things are revealed. We are peeling back the proverbial onion. Our knowing mantra that we wish to share with you is: <em>You are free. You are free. You are free.</em> Feel it, even if you have yet to believe it!</p>
                <p class="hint"><strong>Homework assignment:</strong> Whenever you catch yourself saying, “It is going to turn out this way, I know it, because it always has” simply claim something new. Say instead, “I don’t know how it is going to turn out but all possibilities are available and welcome”.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                <h4>The retrieval.</h4>
                <p>Once you have your self-chatter under control and you are beginning to remember who you are and to reclaim trust in your own worthiness, it is time to get started. Deb will assist you in retrieving your inspiration,; she just has a knack and an inspiration for helping you remember how and why you are here.</p>
                <p>For some people this will be more like an extraction or a birthing event, for others it will just flow smoothly because you have always had an awareness and a relationship with it. And still others may decide that they are not ready. You will get out of it what you are ready to put into it and one thing is for certain: we are all capable and worthy of divinely creative and fulfilling self-expression in whatever way is perfect for each of us. <em>Juicy!</em></p>

            <h1>Unprogramming?</h1>
            <h2>What is <em>“unprogramming”</em>? Don’t you mean “deprogramming”? <br> ---No, not really. </h2>
            <p>All of us have been conditioned to believe certain things about who we are, what success looks like and how we should live our lives. We have agreed to cultural constructs about money, wealth, career, productivity, health, appearance and relationships. We identify with certain aspects of these collective agreements and this identification influences our behavior and the situations and people we surround ourselves with.</p>
            <p>To make shift happen we need to look at what is underneath this layer of agreement and identification. Think of it as a surface layer that obscures our true self from fully expressing our unique creative force. Unprogramming is just the term we use for erasing this veil and giving ourselves permission to peer underneath. It is not a deconstruction or dismantling of beliefs. That is more a process of deprogramming. Unprogramming simply refers to being empowered to push aside who we think we should be, what we think we should do, have, want and how we think we should act. We create a window to our own true knowing (not someone else’s knowing, not someone else’s 12-step program) and we give ourselves permission to reveal our truth.</p>
            <p>That which feels in alignment with our truth we can choose to keep and that which is not can be discarded. We begin to slough off our self-limiting beliefs and realize that each one of us is whole well and resourceful and completely worthy to claim new and exciting possibilities. Or not. If it is too scary to let go of these beliefs and identifications -- by all means -- keep them.</p>
            <p>Unprogramming happens at your own pace, in your own way and at your own time. BodyMindBusiness is here to support you in creating what it is that you need in a way that is perfect for you or your team. If you are starting to catch on, you are beginning to realize that because the process of recreation and the results claimed are ultimately designed by you, it is impossible to define here exactly what happens when you engage with BodyMindBusiness. Hence the unprogramming program. </p>
            <p>You might be asking then, “if its really that easy and its directed by and through me, what do I need BodyMindBusiness for, anyway? Well, maybe you don’t. We know for sure that you are <em>whole, well and resourceful</em> to discover (or remember) your truth and purpose. It is yours, afterall. But, maybe you have forgotten who this whole, well and resourceful you is. Let us show you the amazing person we see so clearly. Or maybe you have hit an obstacle or pinch point and need help navigating through the portal. Or, better yet, maybe we could help you amp it up to a whole new level. </p>

            <h1>Claim of Worth <br>(How We Charge)</h1>
            <h2>How much does a whole new way of being cost? <br>--Now that is an interesting question! How much is it worth to YOU?</h2>
            <p>At BodyMindBusiness we believe that when you exchange money you are exchanging energy. When you contract for our services we want this exchange to be of the highest energy available for the highest good of our clients and ourselves and to be an equal exchange of energy. Claiming a new way of being is an investment made by <em>YOU</em>, through <em>YOU</em> and unique to <em>YOU</em> and requires an energetic investment equal and worthy of your expression and creative drive. We will simply match what you are willing to invest.</p>
            <p>This may seem confusing to you at first and requires a bit of explanation. There are two layers to any transaction.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The actual exchange of goods or services for currency or compensation </strong>and,</li>
                <li><strong>The energetic exchange between the two parties</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>The buyer is satisfied with a transaction when she feels she received value that was commensurate with the dollars she paid. And the seller is satisfied with a transaction when he feels like he was paid adequately given the value of his product. When both parties are happy, there is an equal exchange of energy. A mismatch of energy can lead to dissatisfaction for one or both parties and can create stress, anger, frustration, shame, resentment, fear and remorse.</p>
            <p>You will not be able to claim your newly inspired way of being in alignment with your true full expression from a transaction originating from low level energy like shame and fear. And we will not be able to find our tummy-tickle inspiration in helping you remember your divine purpose when we have agreed to something that is partnered with stress or resentment.</p>
            <p>We do not sell an out-of-the-box, ready-to-wear program. We consider ourselves co-creators in agreement with you and the transformation you are seeking is created through our exchange. As such, it is essential that we start out on the right foot and that we agree to match energies from the start. I ask you again, <em>How much is it worth to you to claim a whole new way of being and to remember how you serve in your full expression?</em> </p>
            <p>The first step in your transformation is to initiate a conversation with one of us at BodyMindBusiness and this is completely free. We want to hear about you, your thoughts, desires, ideas and inspiration. We want to determine if you are a good fit for us and for you to decide if we are a good fit for you. We don’t ask you to subscribe to anything, buy a membership or sign-up for a program. We will not keep your contact information for a mailing list. All conversations are confidential.</p>
            <p>If we are all in agreement to continue this relationship, we will ask you to sign a <strong>Claim of Understanding</strong>. As part of this understanding, we will ask you to create a proposal for compensation. There is no template for this proposal. It is completely up to you and all options are considered. We simply ask that you consult with your knowing and ask yourself how much this transformation is worth to you and what are you willing to invest. If you are unsure at first and feel like you can only make a minimal investment, we completely understand. Please propose a compensation solution that feels right and truthful for you.</p>
            <p>The compensation proposal does not need to be completed prior to your first consultation or coaching session and can be flexible and modified at any time if it is in the highest good of you and BodyMindBusiness. BodyMindBusiness simply matches the investment you are willing to make if we are in alignment with your truth. We reserve the right to decline your proposal, renegotiate and/or dissolve the relationship if we are not aligned with your energetic investment and we determine that it is not in our highest good at the time. We do not judge, we do not evaluate based on the highest bidder. Our purpose is to find that tummy-tickle, awesomely-inspired, fantastically juicy free flow frequency that arises from helping you or your team transform to a new way of being and remember what truly divine, creative, unique and worthy beings we all are.</p>
            <p>We are very curious to meet you and to hear your story! Please <a href="form.php">Contact us today</a>
